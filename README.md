# Uncertain Modelling of Volatility (UMV) and its application in interest rate products

## This repository is a record of what I have done for my MSc Thesis.


This study on the Uncertain Volatility Model (UVM) is divided into five parts: 
- Chapter 1 presents the traditional approaches to interest rate product pricing to review
some of the key definitions and methods used.
- Chapter 2 will introduce Black-Scholes model and compare with the UVM and its Lagrangian approach in equity derivative as
presented in Avellaneda et al. (1995), Avellaneda & Paras (1996).
- Chapter 3 will present the application of UVM approaches in fixed income pricing.
- Chapter4 will discuss the implementation of the UVM model using the finite difference method, and
begin some analysis on linear fixed income products.
- Chapter 5 will implement the numerical scheme on more a complicated product such as convertible bonds.
- Chapter 6 explores an improvement of the model and suggested possible areas for further research.
