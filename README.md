# Uncertain Volatility Model (UMV) and its application in interest rate products

## This repository is a record of what I have done for my MSc Thesis.


This study on the Uncertain Volatility Model (UVM) is divided into five parts: 
- In chapter 1, we present the traditional approaches to interest rate product pricing to review
some of the key definitions and methods used.
- In chapter 2, we will introduce Black-Scholes
model and compare with the UVM and its Lagrangian approach in equity derivative as
presented in Avellaneda et al. (1995), Avellaneda & Paras (1996).
- In chapter 3, we will present the application of UVM approaches in fixed income pricing.
- In chapter4, we will discuss the implementation of the UVM model using the finite difference method, and
begin some analysis on linear fixed income products.
- In chapter 5, we will implement the
numerical scheme on more a complicated product such as convertible bonds.
- Finally in chapter 6, we conducted an analysis to explore an improvement of the model and suggested
possible areas for further research.
